#Experiment 1: Random function approximation using neural network
In this experiment, I will attempt to approximate a random function. The function can have any number of variables. But here, it will be 4.
This should be replaceable with anything you like as long as it doesn't return NaN.
```python```
def a_function(x,y,z,a):
    return (x*(y/(z-a)))
```
